# Hello, I’m Felipe de Jesús
_I have a Doctorate in Science, Applied Physics. At the moment I am in the process of resuming research._

_I am currently teaching at a university, so I will upload some notes for physics and mathematics courses._

## Courses 📚

### Requirements 📋

_We will work with Python and the Wolfram Language, however, it is not necessary to install any programs. You can work from the cloud._

_For Wolfram, [Wolfram Cloud](
https://www.wolframcloud.com/) is recommended._

_For Python [Jupyter in your browser](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is recommended._

### Math 🧮

* Calculus
* [Differential equations](https://github.com/Tlachino-M-FJ/Course-notes/tree/main/Ecuaciones-diferenciales)
* [Linear algebra](https://github.com/Tlachino-M-FJ/Course-notes/tree/main/%C3%81lgebra-Lineal)

### Phisics :atom:

* Theoretical mechanics

## Built with 🛠️

_These notes were made using  and Jupyter (Python and Wolfram Language)_

* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
  * [Python](https://www.python.org/)
  * [Wolfram Language](https://www.wolfram.com/language/)
* [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)

## ©️ Thank you 🍻
